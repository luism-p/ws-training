Implement Assignment Remote Service
====
> ### Exercise Goals
> - Declare dependencies
> - Implement the façade methods for the local service in the `AssignmentServiceImpl.java`
> - Do a final code review
> - Rebuild and deploy the service

### Declare Dependencies
For our implementation, we need to make the Servlet and Portlet API available:

1. **Open** the build.gradle of gradebook-service.
2. **Implement** the new dependencies as follows:
    ```gradle
     compileOnly group: "javax.portlet", name: "portlet-api"
     compileOnly group: "javax.servlet", name: "javax.servlet-api"
    ```
### Implement the Façade Methods
1. **Open** the `AssignmentServiceImpl.java` class. The empty class looks like this:
    ```java
     /**
      * Copyright (c) 2000-present Liferay, Inc. All rights reserved.

      * any later version.
      *
      * This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
      * ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
      * FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more
      * details.
      */
    
     package com.liferay.training.gradebook.service.impl;
    
     import com.liferay.portal.aop.AopService;
     import com.liferay.training.gradebook.service.base.AssignmentServiceBaseImpl;
    
     import org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Component;
    
     /**
      * The implementation of the assignment remote service
      *
      * <p>
      * All custom service methods should be put in this class. Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the <code>com.liferay.training.gradebook.service.AssignmentService</code> interface.
      *
      * <p>
      * This is a remote service. Methods of this service are expected to have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can be accessed remotely.
      * </p>
      *

      */
     @Component(
         property = {
             "json.web.service.context.name=gradebook",
             "json.web.service.context.path=Assignment"
         },
         service = AopService.class
     )
     public class AssignmentServiceImpl extends AssignmentServiceBaseImpl {
    
         /*
          * NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:
          *
          * Never reference this class directly. Always use <code>com.liferay.training.gradebook.service.AssignmentServiceUtil</code> to access the assignment remote service.
          */
     }
    ```
2. **Implement** the façade methods in the class as follows:
    ```java
     public Assignment addAssignment(long groupId, Map<Locale, String> titleMap, Map<Locale, String> descriptionMap, Date dueDate, ServiceContext serviceContext)
         throws PortalException {
    
         return assignmentLocalService.addAssignment(groupId, titleMap, descriptionMap, dueDate, serviceContext);
     }
    
     public Assignment deleteAssignment(long assignmentId)
         throws PortalException {
    
         Assignment assignment = assignmentLocalService.getAssignment(assignmentId);
    
         return assignmentLocalService.deleteAssignment(assignment);
     }
    
     public Assignment getAssignment(long assignmentId)
         throws PortalException {
    
         Assignment assignment = assignmentLocalService.getAssignment(assignmentId);
    
         return assignment;
     }
    
     public List<Assignment> getAssignmentsByGroupId(long groupId) {
    
         return assignmentPersistence.findByGroupId(groupId);
     }
    
     public List<Assignment> getAssignmentsByKeywords(long groupId, String keywords, int start, int end, OrderByComparator<Assignment> orderByComparator) {
    
         return assignmentLocalService.getAssignmentsByKeywords(groupId, keywords, start, end, orderByComparator);
     }
    
     public long getAssignmentsCountByKeywords(long groupId, String keywords) {
    
         return assignmentLocalService.getAssignmentsCountByKeywords(groupId, keywords);
     }
    
     public Assignment updateAssignment(long assignmentId, Map<Locale, String> titleMap, Map<Locale, String> descriptionMap, Date dueDate, ServiceContext serviceContext)
         throws PortalException {
    
         return assignmentLocalService.updateAssignment(assignmentId, titleMap, descriptionMap, dueDate, serviceContext);
     }
   ```

3. **Resolve** missing imports.

### Final Code Review
The complete files will look like this:
```gradle
dependencies {
    compileOnly group: "com.liferay", name: "com.liferay.petra.lang"
    compileOnly group: "com.liferay", name: "com.liferay.petra.string"
    compileOnly group: "com.liferay", name: "com.liferay.portal.aop.api"
    compileOnly group: "com.liferay.portal", name: "com.liferay.portal.kernel"
    compileOnly group: "javax.portlet", name: "portlet-api"
    compileOnly group: "javax.servlet", name: "javax.servlet-api"
    compileOnly group: "org.osgi", name: "org.osgi.annotation.versioning"
    compileOnly group: "org.osgi", name: "org.osgi.core"
    compileOnly group: "org.osgi", name: "org.osgi.service.component.annotations"
    compileOnly project(":modules:gradebook:gradebook-api")
}

buildService {
    apiDir = "../gradebook-api/src/main/java"
}

group = "com.liferay.training.gradebook"

### Rebuild and Deploy the Service
Now it's time to deploy our service to the server.

1. **Run** the buildService Gradle task to regenerate the service.
2. **Start** the server if it's not running.
3. **Drag** the gradebook-api and gradebook-service modules into the Liferay server to deploy the modules.

You should see a success log message if modules were deployed successfully:
```log

2019-03-20 11:32:02.573 INFO  [pipe-start 985][BundleStartStopLogger:39] STARTED com.liferay.training.gradebook.service_1.0.0 [985]
```
